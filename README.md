Secure and Transparent Student Result Management System using Blockchain

Project Overview

This project implements a student result management system that utilizes blockchain technology to ensure the security, immutability, and transparency of academic records. The system offers several advantages over traditional methods:

Enhanced Security: Blockchain's distributed ledger technology safeguards student data from unauthorized access or tampering.
Improved Transparency: All stakeholders (students, institutions, employers) can access a verifiable and immutable record of results, fostering trust and accountability.
Streamlined Verification: Employers and other institutions can instantly verify the authenticity of student results, reducing administrative burdens.
Increased Efficiency: The system automates result recording and distribution processes, saving time and resources.
